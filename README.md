# Clustering Algorithms

## Project description

Contains knn classification and k-means clustering algorithms. Provide classes to work with image color data.

## Screenshots

These are some screenshots generated by the samples.

### Knn 

For this example, we use the following RGB samples for each class:

| Plant         | Soil          | Sky           |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 90, 130, 63   | 244, 174, 129 | 255, 254, 255 |
| 150, 193, 113 | 224, 151, 97  | 127, 169, 210 |
| 41, 47, 39    | 230, 212, 191 | 59, 130, 195  |
| 168, 166, 107 |               | 196, 210, 231 |

A k=3 results in the following output:

### K-means with 20 classes

This sample use k-means to simplify the image into just 20 colors. Closest point to centroid is used as the color of 
each class:

## Change History

- 13/mai/2022 - Separated measurer into 2 interfaces. Replaced Selectors class by SelectorBuilder.
- 12/mai/2022 - Added centroid selection strategies.
- 11/mai/2022 - Full rewrite of the project. 
- 15/dec/2013 - Translated to english and inserted in GitHub
